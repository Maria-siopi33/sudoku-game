# Sudoku Game 🧩

## What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle. The player's goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that:  
- each row,  
- each column,  
- and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids  

contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

- **Dynamic generation of a valid Sudoku puzzle** along with simultaneous storage of its solution.  
- **Interactive user input** allowing placement of numbers in empty cells.  
- **Move correctness checking** with corresponding score updates:  
  - Each correct answer adds **2 points** ✅  
  - Each incorrect answer subtracts **2 points** and increases the error count ❌  
- Ability to "**purchase**" hints to fill in a cell using points 💡
